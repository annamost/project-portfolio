## Tech stack

## Project

In this project I created my own portfolio website using React. I gathered all the data about each project, location of img files, etc. into a json file. This makes it easier to update the website in the future. I started by creating different components for each project (eg. name, image, tags, links) to reuse them for each project. Using .map I could then mount each project onto the website. To display the projects I decided to use a caroussel (React Slick). For each project I created a mockup in Canvas and linked to their GitHub Repo and to where they are deployed. I then created the other sections and also created a reusable component for the skill columns. I then styled the page following the mobile first principle and then after that building the tablet and desktop versions. Added hover effect and a favicon.    

## View it live
Every project should be deployed somewhere. Be sure to include the link to the deployed project so that the viewer can click around and see what it's all about.


## Getting Started with the Project

### Dependency Installation & Startup Development Server

Once cloned, navigate to the project's root directory and this project uses npm (Node Package Manager) to manage its dependencies.

The command below is a combination of installing dependencies, opening up the project on VS Code and it will run a development server on your terminal.

```bash
npm i && code . && npm run dev
```
